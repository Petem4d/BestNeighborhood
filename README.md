# The Best Neighborhoods for Summer Fun in Pittsburgh
### By Group 33: Peter Ford, Nolan Grace, and Gabe Schmidt 

In the proceeding data driven argument, we will make the case that one neighborhood stands above the rest in regards to having summer fun in Pittsburgh. 
We will analyze the City's Playgrounds, Courts, and Parks to see which neighborhood possesses the best summer fun facilities.

In picking our data sets we also considered:
- Swimming Pools
- Public Art
- Fields

Despite these other good(or not so good) candidates, we landed on these three for their quality and max fun relation.
Weighing each of the datasets with equal importance, we will then set out to determine which one can be considered the best.
